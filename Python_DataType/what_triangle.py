# Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Note :
# An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.
